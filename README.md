### What's new?
Added support for Cyrillic characters, and now the output is adapted for AVR microcontrollers, with the ability to add a PROGMEM macro and create the necessary structural ones that make it convenient to work with data. All you need to do is copy and paste the contents of the fields into the appropriate files and you're ready to go!
